# DiscordPlayBot
A bot designed for playing better in-discord games. Thought the luck based simple games most bots had were boring, so this is meant to create more complex and engaging games. Runs multiplayer and singleplayer games, with automatic channel management and multithreading. Ideally each game will be a module so that once a new game is created it can just be uploaded to the main build without any major central code changes.
